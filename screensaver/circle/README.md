# The Circle Screensaver (for Windows)

This is a screensaver hack I created for my home desktop. I say hack because behind the scenes
it is just a bunch of JPG files with different color circles and I use the standard Windows
screensaver program to cycle through them. I like the peacefulness of it and the modern look
it gives my computer late at night.

This is what the screensaver looks like in action:
